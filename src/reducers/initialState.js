Harassment is rampant, and men don't even bother to hide their bias and condescension for female engineers. I've worked in a fair few departments here, so problems appear company wide. HR does exactly nothing to remedy this, but spouts a lot of word-salad lip service. Some managers try to help, but they are generally stymied by the overall uncaring culture and process. Even pushing the misogyny aside, there is surprising amount of unethical behavior at Apple. People regularly either take credit for other's work or blame others (often completely unrelated) for not achieving goals (even if those goals were not based in reality at all).
